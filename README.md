# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Code Alpha Task 1

This project is a machine learning solution to classify Iris flower species using features like petal and sepal lengths/widths.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
The built-in Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets` is used.

## 🧠 Model Used
A `RandomForestClassifier` is used to train the model. The model achieved an accuracy of **~97%**.

## 📈 Output Example
The script also visualizes the **feature importance** using a bar chart.

## 📁 Files Included
- `iris_classification.py`: Full code for model building and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file.
